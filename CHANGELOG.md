## 0.7.0 (2022-12-15)

This release makes iterator creation fallible to avoid potential hangs when there is no available thread to process
any of the iterator work.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7d5b8b870bfca2b1b68de1427fbdc0ec1a1bff2b/> `WalkDirGeneric::try_into_iter()` for early error handling.
   If we can't instantiate the iterator due to a busy thread-pool,
   we can now abort early instead of yielding a fake-entry just to
   show an error occurred. This is the preferred way to instantiate
   a  `jwalk` iterator.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3bf1bc226571869e4a5c357d4f6e40ad0a28f3ff/> Detect possible deadlocks when instantiating a parallel iterator.
   Deadlocks can happen if the producer for results doesn't start as there
   is no free thread on the rayon pool, and the only way for it to become free
   is if the iterator produces results.
   
   We now offer a `busy_timeout` in the relevant variants of the
   `Parallelism` enumeration to allow controlling how long we will wait
   until we abort with an error.

## 0.6.2 (2022-12-13)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-bd3e88017ea29c3b89b518f3a721ba35577b7666/> stalling issue when threadpool is used is no more.
   The issue seems to have been that `install` blocks whereas `spawn`
   properly releases the main thread.
   
   This seems to have been changed subtly due to changes in `rayon`,
   which breaks an assumption on how the code is executed.
   
   Replacing `install()` with `spawn` calls resolved the issue.

## v0.5.0 (2020-03-13)

<csr-id-11fa0bc9e8541af333aafb41cc89218435474df4/>

First major change is that API and behavior are now closer to [`walkdir`] and
jwalk now runs the majority of `walkdir`s tests.

Second major change is the walk can now be parameterized with a client state
type. This state can be manipulated from the `process_read_dir` callback and
then is passed down when reading descendens with the `process_read_dir`
callback.

Part of this second change is that `preload_metadata` option is removed. That
means `DirEntry.metadata()` is never a cached value. Instead you want to read
metadata you should do it in the `process_entries` callback and store whatever
values you need as `client_state`. See this [benchmark] as an example.
